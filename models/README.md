# Models

In this section, you'll find the essential files created during the training process:

1. **fake_news_classifier.joblib**:
   - This file contains the trained model for classifying fake news content. It was developed using the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm and is capable of distinguishing between genuine and fake news articles.

2. **vectorizer.joblib**:
   - This object is a CountVectorizer from scikit-learn. Trained on the dataset, it converts text data into a sparse matrix representation, facilitating the classification process by transforming textual input into a format suitable for machine learning algorithms.

These files play a crucial role in the classification pipeline, enabling the efficient processing and accurate prediction of news article authenticity.
